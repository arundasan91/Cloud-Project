The main dataset is all_clean.csv which you can get from [gradcaffe](https://github.com/deedy/gradcafe_data/tree/master/all).
The dataset can be reduced to the required dataset by running reduce_Dataset.R.
This will generate 'datareduced.csv' file.
'datareduced.csv' file can be filled up using fill_Dataset.R.
This will generate 'finaldataset.csv' which is our final dataset file in csv format.


Thanks to you guys !
